                <p>Alan Walker has achieved remarkable success worldwide with his latest single ”Faded”. Precisely six months after its release Walker returns with the dance pop track “Sing Me To Sleep”. The title is sweet, but the theme is far from a lullaby. Iselin Solheim tells with her dramatic vocals the story about longing for a safe place in a world in constant movement. The video is shot in Hong Kong and takes you on a mission throughout the city.
